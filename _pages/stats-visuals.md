## Interaction Effects

**The key insight:** An interaction effect means the effect of one variable on the outcome *depends on* the level of another variable.

### Example: Education, Experience, and Income

The regression model: **Income = β₀ + β₁(Education) + β₂(Experience) + β₃(Education × Experience)**

That last term (Education × Experience) is the **interaction term**. It creates a "twist" in the relationship.

**Left panel (3D surface):** Shows how income changes across both education and experience simultaneously. Notice the surface isn't flat—it twists like a saddle.

**Right panel (2D lines):** The same relationship, but easier to interpret. Each line shows how education affects income *at different levels of experience*:
- Green line: With only 5 years of experience, more education increases income gradually
- Purple line: With 25 years of experience, more education increases income *much more steeply*

**The key:** The lines are **not parallel**. If there were no interaction, all three lines would be parallel (education would have the same effect regardless of experience). The fact that they fan out shows that education "pays off" more for people with more experience.

### Why Sociologists Care About Interactions

Interaction effects reveal **conditional relationships**—the answer to "it depends" questions:
- Does education affect income the same way for men and women?
- Does parental SES matter more or less depending on the country's level of inequality?
- Does discrimination vary by context?

When you see non-parallel lines, you've found an interaction.
