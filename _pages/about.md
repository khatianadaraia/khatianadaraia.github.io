## Background

I am from Georgia. A small village in the western part of Georgia, Ledgebe. I grew up there, then my parents migrated to Tbilisi, as most rural state employees did. Both of them were school teachers. Their generation, born in the late 1960s, lived the collapse: the disintegration of institutions, the migration to Tbilisi, the entry into informal work and debt.

The Soviet system employed large numbers of educated personnel in rural areas: teachers in village schools, nurses in district clinics, accountants and agronomists on collective farms, librarians and cultural workers in local institutions. These rural state employees were not elite, but neither were they collective farmers or industrial workers. They held credentials, earned salaries, and occupied a distinct position in the Soviet social structure.

When the Georgian state collapsed in the early 1990s, this class was destroyed. Salaries stopped. Institutions ceased functioning. The social position of "village teacher" or "collective farm accountant" lost its material foundation. Many rural state employees migrated to Tbilisi, where they entered the informal economy as traders, service workers, and casual labourers. They arrived with education but without capital, networks, or formal employment prospects. To survive, they borrowed from informal lenders, eventually from the microfinance institutions and banks that emerged in the 2000s. Thirty-five years later, many remain in Tbilisi's informal economy, without property, without savings, carrying debt. Their children, raised under these conditions, often reproduce the pattern.

This was my first sociological observation. And here I am now.

P.S. The cat is from the yard of the Monastery of St. Nino at Bodbe. I hope she is still alive. If not, I guess she wouldn't bother either.
