## Background

I come from a small village in the western part of Georgia, Ledgebe, if the name means anything at all beyond those of us who grew up there. My parents migrated to Tbilisi when I was young, as most rural state employees of their kind eventually did; both of them were school teachers, part of a generation born in the late 1960s that would live through the collapse in all its forms. The disintegration of institutions, the migration to the capital, the entry into informal work and debt; this was the sequence that shaped them, a trajectory so common among their cohort that it hardly bears remarking upon, yet it remains the groundwork of everything that came after.

The Soviet system employed large numbers of educated personnel in rural areas: teachers in village schools, nurses in district clinics, accountants and agronomists on collective farms, librarians and so-called cultural workers in local institutions. These rural state employees occupied a peculiar position in the Soviet social structure, one that resists easy classification. They were not elite, certainly, but neither did they belong to collective farmers bound to the land nor industrial workers. They held credentials, earned salaries, this social group was suspended somewhere between the peasantry from which many had emerged and the urban intelligentsia to which they could never quite belong.

When the Georgian state collapsed in the early 1990s, this class was destroyed, not gradually, not through a slow erosion of status, but abruptly, as the material foundations upon which it had rested simply ceased to exist. Salaries stopped arriving; institutions ceased functioning; the social position of "village teacher" or "collective farm accountant," which had meant something concrete for decades, lost its grounding in a matter of months. What followed was migration to Tbilisi, a movement that mirrored patterns occurring across the post-Soviet space, as rural state employees sought in the capital what their villages could no longer provide. They arrived with education but without capital, without networks, without formal employment prospects, credentials earned under one system rendered largely illegible by another. To survive, they entered the informal economy as traders, service workers, casual labourers; they borrowed from informal lenders, and later, when such institutions emerged in the 2000s, from microfinance organisations and banks that extended credit on barbaric terms (these lending practices persist to this day). Nothing describes post-Soviet Georgia better than what was written two thousand years ago: "For to everyone who has, more will be given... but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away."
Thirty-five years have passed. Many remain where they arrived, still in Tbilisi's informal economy, without property, without savings, carrying debt that has compounded across decades. And their children, raised under these conditions, often find themselves reproducing the pattern, not out of any failure of will or imagination, but because the structural constraints that shaped their parents' trajectories have not meaningfully changed.


This was my first sociological observation. And here I am now.

P.S. The cat is from the yard of the Monastery of St. Nino at Bodbe. I hope she is still alive. If not, I guess she wouldn't bother either.
