## Background

I come from a small village in the western part of Georgia, Ledgebe, if the name means anything at all beyond those of us who grew up there. My parents migrated to Tbilisi when I was young, as most rural state employees of their kind eventually did; both of them were school teachers, part of a generation born in the late 1960s that would live through the collapse in all its forms. The disintegration of institutions, the migration to the capital, the entry into informal work and debt; this was the sequence that shaped them, a trajectory so common among their cohort that it hardly bears remarking upon, yet it remains the groundwork of everything that came after.

The Soviet system employed large numbers of educated personnel in rural areas: teachers in village schools, nurses in district clinics, accountants and agronomists on collective farms, librarians and so-called cultural workers in local institutions. These rural state employees occupied a peculiar position in the Soviet social structure, one that resists easy classification. They were not elite, certainly, but neither did they belong to collective farmers bound to the land nor industrial workers. They held credentials, earned salaries, this social group was suspended somewhere between the peasantry from which many had emerged and the urban intelligentsia to which they could never quite belong.

When the Georgian state collapsed in the early 1990s, this class was destroyed. Salaries stopped. Institutions ceased functioning. The social position of "village teacher" or "collective farm accountant" lost its material foundation. Many rural state employees migrated to Tbilisi, where they entered the informal economy as traders, service workers, and casual labourers. They arrived with education but without capital, networks, or formal employment prospects. To survive, they borrowed from informal lenders, eventually from the microfinance institutions and banks that emerged in the 2000s. Thirty-five years later, many remain in Tbilisi's informal economy, without property, without savings, carrying debt. Their children, raised under these conditions, often reproduce the pattern.

This was my first sociological observation. And here I am now.

P.S. The cat is from the yard of the Monastery of St. Nino at Bodbe. I hope she is still alive. If not, I guess she wouldn't bother either.
